# MSC-Industrial-3-Statement-Model

MSC Industrial (“Company”) MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc (NYSE: MSM), through its subsidiaries, primarily MSC
Industrial Supply Co., is one of the largest industrial equipment distributors in the United States, distributing
metalworking and industrial products.

Based on all available information, construct a basic 3-statement model from scratch for MSM with a 7- year annual
forecast (including stubbed periods) and PowerPoint deck (6-7 slides) based on the following:

• Modelling Assumptions –

  o Use the most recent 10-Q available on (www.sec.gov) as the starting point for the projection period.

  o Assume no refinance of existing debt or other material changes to the capital structure. SOFR + 3% margin
on all existing long-term debt (no PIK). 50bps undrawn fee for any revolver facility. No principal amortization,
excess cash flow sweeps or prepayment of existing credit facility.

  o Simplify balance sheet projections, where possible. Assume no change to the balance of floorplan interest,
operating lease, and other long-term liabilities throughout the forecast period.

  o Forecast working capital as one net working capital (NWC) line item based on a % of revenue.

  o Do not incorporate any advanced depreciation methodology or impacts of recent tax reform.

  o WACC = 9.3%

• Case Outputs –

  o Base Case – Use all publicly available information (SEC filings, analyst coverage, management guidance,
Bloomberg, Factset, Capital IQ, etc.) to develop a Base Case forecast.

  o Downside Case – Stress Base Case assumptions to formulate a Downside Case. Assume a broad economic
downturn attributed to a macroeconomic impact of your choosing (supply chain disruptions, 2025 global
recession, etc.)

• Model Outputs –

  o Use an appropriate valuation methodology to arrive at an enterprise valuation, implied equity value, and
per share value for the common stock across the Base and Downside Case. Assume no issuance of additional
shares.

  o Summary outputs should include projected future earnings performance, free cash flow generation,
capitalization, and credit statistics (Leverage, DSCR, FCCR and Liquidity over the forecast period).

• PowerPoint deck –

  o Company description and recent performance update: Brief introduction to the Company and recent
performance update, highlighting any noteworthy performance trends. (1-2 slides)

  o Industry overview and outlook: Outline the current industry dynamics and near-term outlook to reinforce
the Case Rationale slide. (1 slide)

  o Summary Outputs: Summary outputs from the model across the Base and Downside Case (1 slide each)

  o Case Rationale: Outline the overall theme across both the Base and Downside case. Include rationale for
Revenue, Opex, EBITDA, Capex, Income Tax, and Working Capital assumptions. (1 slide each)

  o Investment Recommendation: Provide your opinion on MSM through an investment recommendation, and
whether you feel the common stock is over or undervalued in the current environment. Include a brief
explanation supporting your thesis. (1 slide)

Any parameters not defined in the case study are to be determined based on your discretion.
